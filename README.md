IRC Bot
=======

Setup
-----

* Clone repository
* `cd irc-bot`
* `mkdir logging/logs`
* `python bot.py`
* `go run logging/serve.go`

TODO
----

* ~~Give a sweet name to our bot :) It hates to be called as "bot"~~ : jec-dev-bot
* Automated reply for some basic messages like "help", "hello" (already done
 but need to improve), "logs" (need to create a logger), etc.
* ~~Find a way to host this script so that it can run 24x7 (May not be possible
 to get a free service for this as the dynos sleep after some time and it may
 not be possible to keep it running)~~: http://139.59.6.26:5000

Thanks to:
